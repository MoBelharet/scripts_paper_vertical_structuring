This repository contains all the codes and data for reproducing all statistical results and generating figures reported in the paper "What determines the vertical structuring of pelagic ecosystems in the global ocean?".
To run the Matlab scripts contained in this repository, a version of Matlab software later than R2022 is required.

To generate the figures reported in the paper, use the "main.m" script from which you can select the figure to generate by setting the corresponding parameter (plot_fig...) to 1. For example, to generate the figure 1 of the paper, 
we must set: plot_fig1 = 1 in the main.m script.

All the data used in this paper are contained in the data/ directory. 
The Matlab scripts and functions used to generate the various figure are contained in the src/ and functions/ directories.
